canUnlockAll
Overview
The canUnlockAll function checks whether all boxes in a given set of sequentially numbered boxes can be opened. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the goal is to determine if it's possible to open all boxes starting from the first box.

Usage
Function Signature
python
Copy code
def canUnlockAll(boxes)
Parameters
boxes: A list of lists, where each list represents a box, and the indices of the outer list represent box numbers. A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
Return Value
True if all boxes can be opened, False otherwise.
Example
python
Copy code
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]
result = canUnlockAll(boxes)
print(result)  # Output: True
Implementation Details
The function utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the connectivity between boxes. It starts from the first box (box 0) and iteratively explores all reachable boxes by using keys found in each visited box. The algorithm marks visited boxes to avoid unnecessary reprocessing.

Assumptions
The input boxes is a valid list of lists, where each inner list contains non-negative integers representing keys to other boxes.

The function assumes that the first box (boxes[0]) is unlocked.

Dependencies
The implementation uses the collections.deque class from the Python standard library.
